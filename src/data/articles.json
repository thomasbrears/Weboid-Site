It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A website that implements SSL/TLS has \"HTTPS\" in its URL instead of \"HTTP\", with the 'S' meaning Secure.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>What is Transport Layer Security (TLS)?</strong></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice-over IP (VoIP). In this article, we will focus on the role of TLS in web application security.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">TLS was proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an international standards organization and the first version of the protocol was published in 1999. The most recent version is TLS 1.3, which was published in 2018.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Are SSL and TLS the same thing?</strong></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">SSL is the direct predecessor of another protocol called TLS (Transport Layer Security). In 1999 the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed an update to SSL. Since this update was being developed by the IETF and Netscape was no longer involved, the name was changed to TLS. The differences between the final version of SSL (3.0) and the first version of TLS are not drastic; the name change was applied to signify the change in ownership.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Since they are so closely related, the two terms are often used interchangeably and confused. Some people still use SSL to refer to TLS; others use the term \"SSL/TLS encryption\" because SSL still has so much name recognition.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong><br></strong></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>How does SSL/TLS work?</strong></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">A SSL/TLS connection is initiated using a sequence known as the TLS handshake. When a user navigates to a website that uses TLS, the TLS handshake begins between the user's device (also known as the client device) and the web server.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">During the TLS handshake, the user's device and the web server:</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Specify which version of TLS (TLS 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) they will use</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Decide on which cipher suites (see below) they will use</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Authenticate the identity of the server using the server's TLS certificate</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Generate session keys for encrypting messages between them after the handshake is complete</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The TLS handshake establishes a cipher suite for each communication session. The cipher suite is a set of algorithms that specifies details such as which shared encryption keys, or session keys, will be used for that particular session. TLS is able to set the matching session keys over an unencrypted channel thanks to a technology known as public key cryptography.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">The handshake also handles authentication, which usually consists of the server proving its identity to the client. This is done using public keys. Public keys are encryption keys that use one-way encryption, meaning that anyone with the public key can unscramble the data encrypted with the server's private key to ensure its authenticity, but only the original sender can encrypt data with the private key. The server's public key is part of its TLS certificate.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Once data is encrypted and authenticated, it is then signed with a message authentication code (MAC). The recipient can then verify the MAC to ensure the integrity of the data. This is kind of like the tamper-proof foil found on a bottle of aspirin; the consumer knows no one has tampered with their medicine because the foil is intact when they purchase it.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Why is SSL/TLS important?</strong></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Originally, data on the Web was transmitted in plaintext that anyone could read if they intercepted the message. For example, if a consumer visits a shopping website, places an order, and enters their credit card number on the website, that credit card number would travel across the Internet unconcealed.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">SSL was created to correct this problem and protect user privacy. By encrypting any data that goes between a user and a web server, SSL ensures that anyone who intercepts the data can only see a scrambled mess of characters. The consumer's credit card number is now safe, only visible to the shopping website where they entered it.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">SSL also stops certain kinds of cyber attacks: It authenticates web servers, which is important because attackers will often try to set up fake websites to trick users and steal data. It also prevents attackers from tampering with data in transit, like a tamper-proof seal on a medicine container.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>What does SSL/TLS do?</strong></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes: Encryption, Authentication, and Integrity.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Encryption: hides the data being transferred from third parties.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Authentication: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Integrity: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>What is an SSL/TLS certificate?</strong></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">SSL can only be implemented by websites with an SSL certificate (technically a \"TLS certificate\"). An SSL certificate is like an ID card or a badge that proves someone is who they say they are. SSL certificates are stored and displayed on the Web by a website's or application's server.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">One of the most important pieces of information in an SSL certificate is the website's public key. The public key makes encryption and authentication possible. A user's device views the public key and uses it to establish secure encryption keys with the web server. Meanwhile, the web server also has a private key that is kept secret; the private key decrypts data encrypted with the public key.</span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Certificate authorities (CA) are responsible for issuing SSL certificates.<br><br></span></p><p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Why should businesses and web applications use the TLS protocol?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">TLS encryption can help protect web applications from data breaches and other attacks. Today, TLS-protected HTTPS is standard practice for websites. The Google Chrome browser gradually cracked down on non-HTTPS sites, and other browsers have followed suit. Everyday Internet users are more wary of websites that do not feature the HTTPS padlock icon.<br><br>Sourced from <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud</a><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\" target=\"_blank\">Flare</a></span></p>",
