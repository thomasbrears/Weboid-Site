							<br /> When you visit our website http://www.weboid.dev (the "Website"), use our social media pages, as the case may be (the "App") and more generally, use any of our services (the "Services", which include the Website and App), we appreciate that you are trusting us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Services immediately. <br />
							<br /> This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our Services (which, as described above, includes our Website and App), as well as, any related services, sales, marketing or events. <br />
							<br /> Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you understand what we do with the information that we collect. <br />
							<br /> 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? </b>

You can opt-out of our marketing emails at any time (see the "WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?" below). <br /> Deliver targeted advertising to you. We may use your information to develop and display personalized content and advertising (and work with third parties who do so) tailored to your interests and/or location and to measure its effectiveness. <br /> For other business purposes. We may use your information for other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing and your experience. We may use and store this information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent. <br />
						<br />
						<b>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</b>
						<br />
						<br /> In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations. <br />
						<br /> We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis: <br /> Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose. <br /> Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests. <br /> Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract. <br /> Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements). <br /> Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. <br /> More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations: <br /> Business Transfers.

						<br />
						<b>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</b>
						<br />
						<br /> In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information. <br />
						<br /> We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice. <br />
						<br />
						<b>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</b>

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years. <br />
						<br /> When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. <br />
						<br />
						<b>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</b>
						<br />
						<br /> In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures. <br />
						<br /> We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. <br />
						<br />
						<b>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</b>

						<br /> If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm. <br />
						<br /> If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html. <br />
						<br /> Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. <br />
						<br />
						<b>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</b>
						<br />
						<br /> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. <br />
						<br /> 9. REVOKED <br />
						<br />
						<b>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</b>

						<br /> In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws. <br />

The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information. <br />
